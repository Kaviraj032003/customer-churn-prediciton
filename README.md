# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is the likelihood of customers discontinuing their relationship with a business. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly classification algorithms, we aim to identify factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `dataset` folder. It includes historical customer data with features such as usage patterns, customer satisfaction scores, and other relevant information. The dataset contains a binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Requirements

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

3. Run the `customer_churn_prediction.py` script to train the model and make predictions:

```bash
python customer_churn_prediction.py
```

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance. It may include visualizations of important features and metrics.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project according to your preferences:

- Modify the dataset: You can replace the existing dataset with your own labeled dataset.
- Adjust model parameters: Experiment with different classification algorithms and hyperparameters in the `customer_churn_prediction.py` script.
- Enhance feature engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to improve model accuracy.
